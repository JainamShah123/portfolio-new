            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p>Design team wanted glassmorphism effects throughout the app. Beautiful mockups with layered blur,
                transparency, and subtle shadows.</p>

            <p>The designs were genuinely stunning. Translucent cards floating over blurred backgrounds, with subtle
                depth and lighting effects. It looked like the future of mobile UI.</p>

            <h2>Reality Check</h2>
            <p>Initial implementation using <code>BackdropFilter</code> everywhere caused frame drops on mid-range
                Android devices. GPU memory usage spiked, and older devices became unusable.</p>

            <p>The problem was that blur effects are expensive. Each <code>BackdropFilter</code> requires the GPU to
                sample and process pixels from layers below, and we had 6-8 blur effects on some screens.</p>

            <h2>Performance Impact</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Frame rate dropped from 60fps to 25fps on Pixel 4a</li>
                <li>GPU memory usage increased by 300%</li>
                <li>Battery drain increased by 60% during active use</li>
                <li>Older devices (3+ years) became completely unusable</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Compromise Strategy</h2>
            <p>Limited blur effects to 3 key screens maximum. Used static gradient overlays instead of live blur where
                possible. Implemented device capability detection with fallback designs for low-end devices.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>Built a <code>PerformanceAwareBlur</code> widget that monitors frame times and automatically disables
                effects when performance degrades. Saved design integrity while maintaining usability.</p>

            <p>The widget tracked frame render times and would progressively disable blur effects if frame budget was
                consistently exceeded.</p>

            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>Beautiful design means nothing if users can't interact with it smoothly. Sometimes the best design
                decision is knowing when to say no.</p>

            <p>We kept the blur effects on the most important screens (onboarding, payment flow) and used simpler
                alternatives elsewhere. Users got the premium feel without the performance cost.</p>

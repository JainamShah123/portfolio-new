            <h2>Growing Pains</h2>
            <p>App grew from 5 screens to 25+ screens. Provider-based state management became a web of dependencies.
                Debugging state changes required tracing through 6+ providers.</p>

            <p>What started as a simple app with basic Provider usage had evolved into a complex application where state
                changes cascaded through multiple providers in unpredictable ways.</p>

            <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
            <p>A simple user profile update was triggering rebuilds in 12 different widgets across 4 screens. Debugging
                required adding print statements throughout the provider chain to understand the flow.</p>

            <p>New team members struggled to understand which provider controlled what state, and we were spending more
                time debugging state issues than building features.</p>

            <h2>Migration Strategy</h2>
            <p>Gradually migrated to Bloc pattern, starting with the most complex features. Kept Provider for simple UI
                state, used Bloc for business logic and cross-screen state.</p>

            <p>We didn't do a big-bang rewrite. Instead, we identified the most problematic areas and migrated them one
                by one over 3 months.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Approach</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bloc for user authentication, app settings, complex forms</li>
                <li>Provider for theme, simple toggles, local UI state</li>
                <li>Repository pattern to abstract data sources</li>
                <li>Clear boundaries between UI state and business state</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
            <p>We established clear rules: if state affects multiple screens or involves business logic, use Bloc. If
                it's purely UI state for a single widget tree, Provider is fine.</p>

            <p>This hybrid approach let us keep the simplicity of Provider where it made sense while gaining the
                predictability of Bloc for complex state.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Development velocity increased as team could work on features independently. Bug reproduction became
                easier with predictable state flows. Testing coverage improved significantly.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, onboarding new developers became much faster. The clear separation between UI and
                business state made the codebase more approachable.</p>

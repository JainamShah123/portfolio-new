            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Real-time trading app needed to update 200+ price widgets every 100ms without dropping frames. Initial
                implementation caused severe UI jank and battery drain.</p>

            <p>Users complained about sluggish scrolling during market hours. Battery life dropped from 8 hours to 3
                hours of active use. The app felt broken when it mattered most.</p>

            <h2>Investigation</h2>
            <p>Flutter DevTools revealed excessive widget rebuilds. Each price update triggered full
                <code>ListView</code> reconstruction, causing 60fps drops to 15fps during market hours.
            </p>

            <p>The issue was in our state management approach. We were using a single <code>ChangeNotifier</code> for
                all price data, so any price change rebuilt the entire list of 200+ widgets.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Implemented selective widget updates using <code>ValueListenableBuilder</code> with individual price
                notifiers. Added frame budget monitoring to batch updates when system is under pressure.</p>

            <p>Key changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Split monolithic state into individual <code>ValueNotifier&lt;Price&gt;</code> instances</li>
                <li>Used <code>ValueListenableBuilder</code> for each price widget</li>
                <li>Implemented frame budget monitoring with <code>SchedulerBinding</code></li>
                <li>Added update batching when frame time exceeded 16ms</li>
                <li>Cached widget instances for unchanged prices</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Maintained 60fps during peak trading hours. Battery usage reduced by 40%. Memory allocation dropped from
                2MB/s to 200KB/s during active updates.</p>

            <p>More importantly, user complaints about performance disappeared. The app now felt responsive even during
                the most volatile market conditions.</p>

            <h2>Lessons</h2>
            <p>Widget granularity matters more than clever state management. Sometimes the best optimization is knowing
                when not to update.</p>

            <p>Performance isn't just about algorithms — it's about user experience. A technically perfect solution that
                drops frames is worse than a simple solution that maintains 60fps.</p>
